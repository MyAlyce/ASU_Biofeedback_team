# CSE 485 Capstone Project MyAlyce

## Project Description

The MyAlyce Brain Training & Study Boost App aims to create a mobile application that uses
Hemoencephalography (HEG) to enhance cognitive performance and improve mental health.
This app will provide interactive brain-training games and real-time neurofeedback, allowing
users to boost focus, reduce stress, and improve their overall well-being.
A key component of the application is its open-source foundation. This allows users a low-cost
and accessible solution that can be iterated over by the community. This app will be designed
for students and individuals who want to sharpen their cognitive abilities and manage stress.
A key feature of this application is integration with popular streaming services such as Spotify,
YouTube Music, SoundCloud, etc. The app will help find music to help users maintain and
optimize their mental performance by connecting a user's music while receiving real-time
neurofeedback. This unique approach of combining music with brain activity monitoring aims to
provide a tailored cognitive improvement experience.
MyAlyce will also feature a selection of brain-training games to increase blood flow and mental
sharpness within the brain. Blood flow levels and other metrics will be stored and analyzed to
track baselines for users to show their improvement over time.
The overall goal is to make this rising technology both accessible and affordable, offering tools
that enhance cognitive function and manage mental health. By combining neuroscience,
personalized feedback, and affordability, the MyAlyce app seeks to become a powerful resource
for individuals looking to improve mental clarity and reduce stress.
